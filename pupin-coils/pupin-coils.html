                    A loading coil or load coil is an inductor that is inserted into an electronic circuit to increase
                     its inductance. 
                    The term originated in the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in long-distance
                     telegraph 
                    transmission cables. The term is also used for inductors in radio antennas, or between the antenna and 
                    feedline,
                    to make an electrically short antenna resonant at its operating frequency.
                    The concept of loading coils was discovered by Oliver Heaviside in studying the problem of slow 
                    signalling speed of the first transatlantic telegraph cable in the 1860s. He concluded additional
                    inductance was required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the transmitted signal. 
                    The mathematical condition for distortion-free transmission is known as the Heaviside condition. 
                    Previous telegraph lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need for extra 
                    inductance was not as great. Submarine communications cables are particularly subject to the problem,
                    but early 20th century installations using balanced pairs were often continuously loaded with iron wire
                    or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which avoided the sealing problem.
                    Loading coils are historically also known as Pupin coils after Mihajlo Pupin, especially when 
                    used for the Heaveside condition and the process of inserting them is sometimes called pupinization.

<p style="color:black;font-size:20px;font-family:sans-serif">Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the 
pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside">Oliver Heaviside</a>, which predates Pupin's 
patent by some seven years.<br><br> The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to 
it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.<br> Although AT&T bought 
Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ashley_Campbell">George Campbell</a> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.<br> <br>
AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its
ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>

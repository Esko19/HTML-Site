          <p> When the United States joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">First World War</a> in 1917, Pupin was working at Columbia University,
               organizing a research group for submarine detection techniques.[15] Together with his colleagues, 
               professors Wils and Morcroft, he performed numerous researches with the aim of discovering submarines
                at Key West and New London. He also conducted research in the field of establishing telecommunications
                 between places. During the war Pupin was a member of the state council for research and state advisory 
                 board for aeronautics. For his work he received a laudative from president 
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding">Warren G. Harding,</a> which was published on page 386 of his autobiography.

      <p id="p1">Columbia University's Physical Laboratories building, built in 1927, is named Pupin Hall</a>
          in his honor. It houses the physics and astronomy departments of the university. During Pupin's tenure, 
          Harold C. Urey, in his work with the hydrogen isotope deuterium demonstrated the existence of heavy water,
           the first major scientific breakthrough in the newly founded laboratories (1931). In 1934 Urey was awarded 
           the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the work he performed 
          in Pupin Hall related to his discovery of "heavy hydrogen".[28]</p>

        <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;font-family:sans-serif">Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 
        9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935), also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American 
        physicist and physical chemist.<br><br>

        Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range
        of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined 
        intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization"). <br><br>

        Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 
        on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA. <br> 
        In 1914, Pupin formed "Fund Pijade Aleksić-Pupin" within the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts[19] 
        to commemorate his mother Olimpijada for all the support she gave him through life.
